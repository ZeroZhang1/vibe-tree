# 🌳 Vibe Tree

[简体中文](README.md) | English

**Every token your coding agent spends grows a little tree on your desktop.**

Vibe Tree is a desktop-resident token weather tree — it turns the cost, rhythm, and activity of vibe coding into a pixel bonsai you can nurture.

> Works on macOS / Windows / Linux. Dev mode: `npm run dev`

## Why Vibe Tree?

### 🌱 Make Coding Feel Alive
A transparent floating window lives on your desktop. The tree grows as tokens are consumed. Total XP determines your level; recent activity drives the weather — the more you code, the more your tree flourishes.

### 📊 See Where Your Tokens Go
The manager panel shows source breakdowns, model ratios, and 7-day charts. View all agents or drill into a single agent's input / output / cache details.

### 🏅 Unlock Legendary Achievements
The built-in achievement system tracks streaks, total usage, and coding rhythm, then celebrates key moments with a small pixel toast.

### 🏆 Compete with Global Vibe Coders
An optional global leaderboard — sign in with GitHub to join. Only daily token totals are uploaded; no code or session content ever leaves your machine.

## Product Direction

Vibe Tree is not just a token dashboard. The goal is to make vibe coding's cost and rhythm perceivable through a desktop companion. The first version prioritizes reliable multi-agent local ingestion; future work refines pet behavior, weather feedback, and game balance.
