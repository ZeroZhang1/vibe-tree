# 🌳 Vibe Tree

[简体中文](README.md) | English

**Every token your coding agent spends makes the tiny tree on your desktop grow.**

Vibe Tree is a desktop token weather tree for AI coding. It reads local usage records from your coding agents and turns token spend, active rhythm, model preference, and streaks into a pixel bonsai you can keep on your desktop.

It is not just a token dashboard. It is a small companion that makes your coding pace visible, collectible, and shareable.

## Screenshots

### Live Growth Dashboard

Track total tokens, today's growth, level progress, agent sources, and the recent 7-day trend.

### Shareable Growth Report

Export one of three visual templates with level, total tokens, favorite agent, a 7 × 24 hour heatmap, and a GitHub QR code.

### Global Leaderboard

Opt into the leaderboard with GitHub. By default, only aggregated token ranking data is public. Usage preferences are shown only when the user explicitly enables them.

## Highlights

- **Desktop pixel tree**: always-on-top, draggable, scalable, lockable, and quiet on startup.
- **Live token weather**: total tokens drive level growth; current token/min drives weather.
- **Multi-agent sources**: Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, Pi Agent, OpenCode, Gemini, and Hermes.
- **Source and model breakdowns**: inspect input, output, cache, and model distribution by agent.
- **One tree across devices**: sign in with the same GitHub account to sync level, total tokens, achievements, device contributions, and aggregate model share across Windows and Mac.
- **Recent 7-day chart**: filter token trends by source.
- **Achievements**: unlock milestones for totals, peaks, streaks, time habits, and agent usage.
- **Share image export**: choose from three templates and export a high-resolution PNG.
- **Three UI themes**: day, night, and soft, aligned with the share-card visual system.
- **Leaderboard privacy controls**: joining is optional; public usage preferences are opt-in.
- **Chinese and English UI**: switch language in settings.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

Development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

If Electron downloads slowly from GitHub, temporarily use a mirror:

```bash
ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/ \
npm_config_electron_mirror=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/ \
npm ci
```

Or save it in `.npmrc`:

```ini
electron_mirror=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/
```

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Status | Default source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | ✅ | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` |
| Claude Code | ✅ | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` |
| OpenClaw | ✅ | `~/.openclaw/agents/**/sessions/*.jsonl` |
| Pi Agent | ✅ | `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl` |
| OpenCode | ✅ | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (legacy `storage/message/**/*.json` remains supported) |
| Gemini | ✅ | local Gemini session directory |
| Hermes | ✅ | local Hermes session directory |

Vibe Tree auto-detects the default paths after installation. You can customize source paths or disable sources in settings.

## Data And Privacy

Vibe Tree is local-first. By default, it does not upload code, prompts, filenames, paths, conversation logs, or complete hourly heatmaps.

When "One tree, many devices" is enabled, it syncs only the growth data needed for the shared tree: token events, safe source categories, device id, coarse device summaries, achievement state, and daily token totals grouped by device/source/model. It does not upload individual session text, prompts, replies, local paths, or code files.

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the full data-handling details.

When joining the leaderboard, it syncs daily token totals, recent hourly token aggregates, and the local first-use date so the service can compute 24h, 7-day, 30-day, and all-time rankings. If "Public usage preferences" is enabled, it additionally syncs four aggregated fields:

- Favorite agent
- Favorite model
- Favorite coding period
- Peak token rate

These fields are used only for leaderboard display.

## Token Accounting

```text
Counted Token = inputTokens + outputTokens + cacheReadTokens + cacheWriteTokens
```

Some providers include cached input in `inputTokens`; Anthropic reports cache read / write separately. Vibe Tree counts total token consumption per request and counts cached input only once when it is already included in `inputTokens`.

By default, statistics start from the installation day. Older history is ignored unless explicitly imported with environment variables.

## Import History

macOS / Linux:

```bash
VIBE_CODEX_IMPORT_HISTORY=today \
VIBE_CLAUDE_IMPORT_HISTORY=today \
VIBE_OPENCLAW_IMPORT_HISTORY=today \
VIBE_OPENCODE_IMPORT_HISTORY=today \
npm start
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:VIBE_CODEX_IMPORT_HISTORY="today"
$env:VIBE_CLAUDE_IMPORT_HISTORY="today"
$env:VIBE_OPENCLAW_IMPORT_HISTORY="today"
$env:VIBE_OPENCODE_IMPORT_HISTORY="today"
npm start
```

## Cloud Sync And Leaderboard Service

The hosted app uses the configured Cloudflare Worker by default. For local testing or self-hosting:

```bash
VIBE_TREE_LEADERBOARD_API_URL=https://your-worker.workers.dev npm start
```

Worker template:

```text
server/leaderboard-worker/
```

## Game Balance

Growth, weather, and activity windows are configured in:

```text
public/assets/trees/vibe-bonsai/config/game-balance.json
```

It contains token level curves, weather thresholds, growth-stage thresholds, and activity-window parameters.
